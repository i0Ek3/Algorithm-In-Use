# Algorithm In Use

The goal of the project is to improve the actual coding and thinking skills through algorithmic learning. This project will continue to improve, I hope you can find what you need here. Enjoy it, please let me know if you have any questions, thanks a lot.

## Log

Maybe I should divide the algorithm into different class, such as array, stack, and so on, okay, I will do it.
